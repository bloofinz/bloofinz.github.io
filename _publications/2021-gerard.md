Abstract
---
Western Atlantic bluefin tuna (ABT) undertake long-distance migrations from rich feeding grounds in the North Atlantic to spawn in oligotrophic waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).  Stock recruitment is strongly affected by interannual variability in the physical features associated with larvae, but the biogeochemical and food-web properties of preferred habitat, the outer edges of anticyclonic loop eddies , are unknown.  Here, we describe the goals, physical context, design and major findings of an end-to-end, process-oriented study conducted during peak ABT spawning in May 2017 and 2018.  Loop eddy edges in the oceanic GoM were surveyed for larvae, and five multi-day lagrangian experiments (cycles) measured hydrography and nutrients; biomass and composition of the plankton community from bacteria to zooplankton; phytoplankton nutrient uptake, productivity, new production and growth rates; micro- and mesozooplankton grazing; particle export profiles; and ABT larval feeding and growth rates.  In addition to providing a general introduction to the BLOOFINZ-GoM project (Bluefin Larvae in Oligotrophic Ocean Foodwebs, Investigation of Nitrogen to Zooplankton), we highlight the specific finding, based on water-parcel backtracking, that a strong connection to and lateral transport from the continental slope region may be a key determinant of the available eddy edge habitat most utilized by larvae.
